            "data": "This combo revolves around having Black Metal Dragon and Chamber Dragonmaid in your hand and lets you end on a board of Hieratic Seals of the Heavenly Spheres and Dragonmaid Tidying.\n\nTo begin, you start off by summoning Black Metal Dragon. Then, you link Black Metal Dragon off to summon Striker Dragon from your Extra Deck. This sends Black Metal Dragon to the graveyard, allowing you to activate its effect in order to add a Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon from your deck to your hand (if you already have it in your hand, you can simply skip the Striker Dragon summon).\n\nYou then banish Striker Dragon in order to Special Summon Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon to the field as per its summoning requirements. After this, you can activate the effect of Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon in order to Special Summon Chamber Dragonmaid from your hand, thereby activating her effect in order to search for a 'Dragonmaid' spell or trap card from your deck and add it to your hand. This is how you search out Dragonmaid Tidying.\n\nFinally, you use both Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon and Chamber Dragonmaid in order to Special Summon Hieratic Seals of the Heavenly Spheres to your Extra Monster Zone, before setting Dragonmaid Tidying to the field as well.\n\nThis line gives you access to two disruptions in the form of Seals and Tidying, with Seals allowing you to summon Nurse Dragonmaid whose effect lets you summon back Chamber Dragonmaid from your graveyard. You can then use Chamber Dragonmaid's effect in order to grab another spell card from your deck for your next turn."
